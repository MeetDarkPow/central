# r-community.org
r-community.org is thought to be a central place to find data and trends around the global R ecosystem.

# Why this website?
We hope that using this suite of dashboards:
- newbies to the R community can find/explore local and global user-groups, events and important resources.
- Current users can find trends about the important stuff around the global community.
- Organizations that offer trainings/workshops could find trending topics and subjects users are more interested in.
- Event organizers can find sponsors, speakers, understand subjects that have been covered in the past and what still remains.
- Those planning user-expansion/diversity packages can find under-represented regions/areas.
- R enthusiasts/evangelists can be sure (based on verifiable data) when R is really increasing in popularity or declining and we all don't depend on biased rankings
- With leaderboards, encourage social and technical participation across different spaces within the R ecosystem.
